# Comparing-ML-models
In this project, I aimed to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not, using four popular machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The models are evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) scores. The results from these models provide insights into the most effective approach for predicting term deposit subscriptions and can help inform future marketing strategies.
